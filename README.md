# Money Clac: Calculate Your Future Savings

Money Clac is a handy web app that helps you estimate how much money you'll have after a certain period of time, considering daily deposits and (optionally) interest.

## How to Use

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Enter the amount of money you have today. For example, if you have ₹1000 in savings, enter that value.

2. **Daily Deposit:**
   Enter the amount you plan to deposit daily. For example, if you plan to save ₹50 every day, enter that value.

3. **Number of Days:**
   Enter the number of days for your savings goal. For example, if you're aiming to save for a year, enter 365.

4. **Calculate:**
   Click the "Calculate" button to see your estimated future savings.

## Output

The app will display your estimated total amount after the specified number of days. For instance, if you entered an initial amount of ₹1000, a daily deposit of ₹50, and a duration of one year (365 days), the output might show:

> Your total savings after one year will be approximately ₹191,250 (assuming no interest is accrued).

## Additional Considerations

* **Interest:** If Money Clac considers interest, you'll be able to enter an interest rate to get a more accurate estimate of your future savings. The app will explain how the interest is calculated (e.g., simple or compound interest).
* **Error Handling:** The app will prevent you from entering invalid values, such as negative amounts or non-numeric characters.
* **Customization:** You might be able to customize the currency displayed in the output or choose a different number format (e.g., commas for thousands separators).

By following these steps and considering any additional features, you can create a clear and informative markdown file for your Money Clac web app.
